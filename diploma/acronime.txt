OSI - Open System Interconnection
IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
FCS - Frame Check Sequence
CFI - Canonical Format Indicator is always set to zero for Ethernet switches.
      CFI is used for compatibility reason between Ethernet type network and
	  Token Ring type network. If a frame received at an Ethernet port has a
	  CFI set to 1, then that frame should not be forwarded as it is to an
	  untagged port.
