CONFIG_BONDING:

Say 'Y' or 'M' if you wish to be able to 'bond' multiple Ethernet
Channels together. This is called 'Etherchannel' by Cisco,
'Trunking' by Sun, and 'Bonding' in Linux.

If you have two Ethernet connections to some other computer, you can
make them behave like one double speed connection using this driver.
Naturally, this has to be supported at the other end as well, either
with a similar Bonding Linux driver, a Cisco 5500 switch or a
SunTrunking SunSoft driver.

This is similar to the EQL driver, but it merges Ethernet segments
instead of serial lines.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
will be called bonding.
