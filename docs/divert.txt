CONFIG_NET_DIVERT:

The Frame Diverter allows you to divert packets from the
network, that are not aimed at the interface receiving it (in
promisc. mode). Typically, a Linux box setup as an Ethernet bridge
with the Frames Diverter on, can do some *really* transparent www
caching using a Squid proxy for example.

This is very useful when you don't want to change your router's
config (or if you simply don't have access to it).

The other possible usages of diverting Ethernet Frames are
numberous:
- reroute smtp traffic to another interface
- traffic-shape certain network streams
- transparently proxy smtp connections
- etc...
