This patch is intended for the kernel src.rpm supplied with Beta2
version of the RHEL 6 distribution.

The stock src.rpm (and pre-compiled kernel packages) have a problem in
the raid456 module. There is an option than enables a new, multithreaded
model, and it's enabled by default. The multithreaded model seems to be
highly unstable, spawning a large number of threads and causing a huge
load without actually doing anything.

Although this is not related to LiSA in any way, one of the 2 provided
patches disables the multithread option for the raid456 model. If you're
building kernel packages and intend to use them in a raid5 setup (like I
did), then you most probably want to build the packages without the
multithread model.

The kernel-2.6.spec.patch file contains the normal LiSA patch, which has
nothing to do with the raid456 model.

The kernel-2.6.spec-raid456.patch also disables CONFIG_MULTICORE_RAID456
in the default kernel config, making the raid456 module usable.
