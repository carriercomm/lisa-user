<tr><td><h1>About</h1>
<p>LISA stands for <b>LI</b>nux <b>S</b>witching <b>A</b>ppliance. It's a project that
aims at building a network multilayer switching device that runs on a (slightly modified)
PC hardware architecture running Linux.
<p>The device should be able to perform Layer 2 and Layer 3 packet switching and run
dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF and BGP. The configuration and operation command line
interface will be similar to Cisco's IOS.
<p>The project will not compete with Cisco (we could not do that anyway :P) but should
provide a cost-effective advanced-featured solution for small networks.
<p>The project is divided into several smaller projects:
<ul>
<li><a href="switch.html" target="main">Linux Multilayer Switch</a> - The very heart of
the LISA project. It's a Linux kernel module that performs Layer 2 switching and
implements virtual interfaces for inter-vlan routing.
<li><a href="blank.html" target="main">Command Line Interface</a> - A Cisco-like command
line interface that works closely with the kernel module to configure and control the
switching process.
<li><a href="blank.html" target="main">Switch Minilinux Distro</a> - A tiny Linux distro
that only includes the necessary components to run the multilayer switching system.
<li><a href="blank.html" target="main">BIOS / Monitor</a> - Bootstrap code that starts
up the system, initializes and configures the mainboard chipset and boots the kernel.
<li><a href="blank.html" target="main">Flash Emulator</a> - A hardware device that
does in-system programming of the BIOS flash memory.
</ul>

at the Politechnical University in Bucharest, Romania. The project is
