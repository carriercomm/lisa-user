<tr><td><h1>Linux Multilayer Switch</h1>
<p>This is the very heart of the LISA project. It consists of a kernel
module that performs layer 2 switching and implements virtual interfaces
for inter-vlan routing.
<p>We hope this will be integrated into the official Linux kernel someday,
but first our code must reach maturity and then we must prove the
kernel team that it's ok.
<p>This is not just a standalone module, but also a bunch of minor patches
for the kernel networking code. We had to hook into the packet reception
code. There's also a hook in the socket ioctl code to implement "deviceless"
ioctl's on sockets.
<p>This subproject also includes a user space tool to manage the various
features of the kernel module.
