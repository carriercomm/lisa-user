<tr><td><h1>Linux Multilayer Switch</h1>
<p>This is the very heart of the LISA project. It consists of a kernel
module that performs layer 2 switching and implements virtual interfaces
for inter-vlan routing.
<p>We hope this will be integrated into the official Linux kernel someday,
but first our code must reach maturity and then we must prove the
kernel team that it's ok.
<p>This is not just a standalone module, but also a bunch of minor patches
for the kernel networking code. We had to hook into the packet reception
code. There's also a hook in the socket ioctl code to implement "deviceless"
ioctl's on sockets.
<p>This subproject also includes a user space tool to manage the various
features of the kernel module.
<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>This is now a separate section of the site. Use the "Downloads" link
in the menu on the left, or click <a href="download.html">here</a>.
<h1>History</h1>
<ul>
<li>2005, June 15 - A lot of work has been done and now the basic functionality
is complete. We've gone through a bug fixing and testing period and now LiSA
seems to be pretty stable. We are very busy with the bachelor degree papers and
presentations and we've got very little spare time left. The site will hopefully
be redesigned and reorganized when we're done.
<li>2005, March 23 - Working vlan database, forwarding database and
ioctl's
<li>2005, March 12 - The first changes in the kernel code and the first
lines of code that actually do something (besides the dummy "Hello world" :P)
<li>2005, February 27 - First entry in the version control system; a few
documentation and links files
</ul>
