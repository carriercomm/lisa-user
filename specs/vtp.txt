From http://www.hackingciscoexposed.com/pdf/chapter12.pdf:

VTP is a yet another Cisco proprietary protocol designed to make the network administrator’s
life easier by enabling centralized administration of VLANs. VTP data
propagates inside 802.1q or ISL frames on VLAN 1. These frames are sent to the destination
MAC address 01.00.0C.CC.CC.CC with a Logical Link Control (LLC) code AAAA
and a type of 2004 in the SNAP header.

To use VTP, switches have to be added to a VTP domain as VTP servers, clients, or transparent
devices. When a new VLAN is confi gured on a VTP server, it will be automatically
distributed among all switches in the VTP domain. Switches confi gured as transparent will
propagate VTP information without altering their own VLAN assignments. On a network
with dozens of operational Catalyst switches, this is very useful. At the same time, if an attacker
can insert a rogue VTP server into the domain, she would have complete control over
the VTP domain VLANs. To stop it, VTP implements MD5-based frame authentication.
Unfortunately, in our experience, many system administrators don’t turn it on. But even so,
an attacker can crack the MD5 hash if a guessable password is in use.
